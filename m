That's nice, much better and it is right where the structure is defined
making it more likely to stay there over time.

Like this?

	#define struct_group_first(s, n)	static_assert(offsetof(s, n) == sizeof(s), "struct member likely outside of __struct_group(), please fix!")

And then the above would be:
struct_group_fist(struct libipw_hdr_3addr, payload);

Hm, use of "payload" here feels odd but you get the idea.

I don't :)
