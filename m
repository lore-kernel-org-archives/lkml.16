ah, i see. yeah, that makes sense. (amusingly, i almost quipped "it's
not like there are _that_ many clocks to go in there" in my previous
mail, forgetting that there are effectively an unbounded number of
clocks thanks to this feature!)

(even as someone who doesn't work on the kernel, things like this are
always helpful --- just having one thing to understand/your first grep
being relevant is much nicer than "oh, wait ... which architecture was
that?".)
