I'm glad you don't personally mind it. Are you going to help maintain
another memory mapped section?

RT tasks don't have a time slice. They are affected by events. An external
interrupt coming in, or a timer going off that states something is
happening. Perhaps we could use this for SCHED_RR or maybe even
SCHED_DEADLINE, as those do have time slices.

But if it does get used, it should only be used when the task being
scheduled is the same SCHED_RR priority, or if SCHED_DEADLINE will not fail
its guarantees.

And that would be a poorly designed system, and not the problem of the
kernel.

Correct. And why I don't think this should be used for RT. It's SCHED_OTHER
that doesn't have any control of the sched tick, where this hint can help.

Have you worked on any RT projects before?
