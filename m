Note, I only mentioned this because Peter had it in his patch he
created when I first brought this up.

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231030132949.GA38123@noisy.programming.kicks-ass.net/

 SYSCALL_DEFINE0(sched_yield)

Yes, I know the historical meaning. It's also a system call I've been
telling people to avoid for the last 20 years. I haven't seen or heard
about any application that actually depends on that behavior today.

If it's RT, it would set NEED_RESCHED and not LAZY. This is only for
SCHED_OTHER. Sure, it could be a task with a negative nice value.

The optimization would only treat sched_yield differently if the task
had asked for an extended time slice, and it was granted. Like in
Peter's patch, if that was the case, it would just call schedule and
return. This would not affect yield() for any other task not
implementing the rseq extend counter.

I'm not confused.

And before seeing Peter's use of yield(), I was reluctant to use it for
the very same reasons you mentioned above. In my test programs, I was
simply using getuid(), as that was one of the quickest syscalls.
