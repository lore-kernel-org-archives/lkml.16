Thinking more about how EDK2 is consumed downstream, I think reverting the =
EDK2
changes is necessary regardless of what happens in the kernel.  Or at the l=
east,
somehow communicate to EDK2 users that ingesting those changes is a bad ide=
a
unless the kernel has also been updated.

AFAIK, Bring Your Own Firmware[*] isn't widely adopted, which means that th=
e CSP
is shipping the firmware.  And shipping OVMF/EDK2 with the "ignores MTRRs" =
code
will cause problems for guests without commit 8e690b817e38 ("x86/kvm: Overr=
ide
default caching mode for SEV-SNP and TDX").  Since the host doesn't control=
 the
guest kernel, there's no way to know if deploying those EDK2 changes is saf=
e.

I assume by "Re-use MTRRs for the communication" you also mean updating the=
 guest
to address the "everything is UC!" flaw, otherwise another con is:

   - Con: Doesn't address the performance issue with TDX guests "using" UC
          memory by default (unless there's yet more enabled).

Presumably that can be accomplished by simply skipping the CR0.CD toggling,=
 and
doing MTRR stuff as nonrmal?

Not for KVM guests.  As I laid out in my bug report, it's safe to assume MT=
RRs
don't actually affect the memory type when running under KVM.

FWIW, PAT doesn't "work" on most KVM Intel setups either, because of misgui=
ded
KVM code that resulted in "Ignore Guest PAT" being set in all EPTEs for the
overwhelming majority of guests.  That's not desirable long term because it
prevents the guest from using WC (via PAT) in situations where doing so is =
needed
for performance and/or correctness.

>  - Pro: More pure solution

MTRRs "not working" is a red herring.  The problem isn't that MTRRs don't w=
ork,
it's that the kernel is (somewhat unknowingly) using MTRRs as a crutch to g=
et the
desired memtype for devices.  E.g. for emulated MMIO, MTRRs _can't_ be virt=
ualized,
because there's never a valid mapping, i.e. there is no physical memory and=
 thus
no memtype.  In other words, under KVM guests (and possibly other hyperviso=
rs),
MTRRs end up being nothing more than a communication channel between guest =
firmware
and the kernel.

The gap for CoCo VMs is that using MTRRs is undesirable because they are co=
ntrolled
by the untrusted host.  But that's largely a future problem, unless someone=
 has a
clever way to fix the kernel mess.
