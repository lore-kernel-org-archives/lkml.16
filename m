Thanks for writing this up.  I agree BPF approach is better but it has
its own limitation - basically it requires root.  And I know a few of
people who don't use BPF. :)  And maybe we need to check if user passes
filters to the event already.

Also, I admit that I don't know who actually uses this.  But I can say
sometimes people uses tools in a creative way.  Anyway, I can imagine
an use case that system is in a steady state and each user has dedicated
jobs.  Then scanning /proc would work well.

Thanks,
Namhyung
