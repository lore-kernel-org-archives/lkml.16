OK, these look like iommu-dma addresses, and the fact that they're up 
into the full 64-bit space implies that the 32-bit ones are most likely 
also kernel DMA burning through the whole 32-bit IOVA space rather than 
inadvertent physical address (and possibly the SATA driver is leaking 
DMA mappings as it keeps getting errors and retrying?). Indeed it seems 
the firmware stuff probably was a red herring.

I guess that then points to a question of whether it's maybe just the 
SATA driver going wonky and trying to make the device write to a 
DMA_TO_DEVICE mapping, or something going awry at the IOMMU to divert 
the device accesses to a different address space from the one iommu-dma 
believes it's using...

Oh, it's certainly not impossible that that getting VFIO involved may 
tickle some bug or misconfiguration wherein the wrong device ends up 
inadvertently attached to the wrong domain. I don't know the ins and 
outs of debugging with the AMD driver, though, so I think this is the 
point where I have to leave this one to Vasant :)

Thanks,
Robin.
