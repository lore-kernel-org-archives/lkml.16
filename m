I don't have a strong opinion here. Reparenting is clearly not perfect,
but I agree that we don't have any better solutions, only vague ideas.
I believe Muchun's code would require some refresh, but generally is fine
to merge.

This all comes up to the handling of memory shared between cgroups.
Sharing can be spatial (2 or more simultaneously existing cgroups) or
temporal (a cgroup is being deleted and recreated, the workload tries to
reuse old pages). The reparenting turns temporal sharing into the spacial.
It helps with dying cgroups, but comes at the cost of permanently wrong
accounting and issues with the memory protection.

Thanks!
