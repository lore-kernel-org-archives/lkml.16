Unfortunately it looks like the answer hasn't changed since last year. I
am testing this series on an Arm Fast Models platform (FVP) [1], which
does support POE. I've included instructions to get you started at the end.

I could certainly add some tests there, but I wonder if such crash tests
provide much benefit compared to the KUnit tests (that rely on
copy_to_kernel_nofault()) in patch 15? Not crashing the kernel does mean
that many of those tests can be run in a row :)

I wouldn't say "leaking" is the issue here, but yes conceptually
exception handlers should run with a fixed pkey configuration, not that
of the interrupted context. As Dave Hansen pointed out [2], what is even
more important is to context-switch the pkey register. A thread may be
interrupted and scheduled out while executing at a higher kpkeys level;
we want to ensure that this thread resumes execution at the same kpkeys
level, and that in the meantime we return to the standard level.

Only one key is used (besides the default key) in this initial RFC.
However, the idea behind the level abstraction is indeed that (RW)
access to multiple keys may be required at the same time. In the
follow-up RFC protecting credentials, this is illustrated by the
"unrestricted" level that grants RW access to all keys. I believe this
approach is the most flexible, in that any permission mapping can be
defined for each level.

As mentioned above I tested this series on Arm FVP. By far the easiest
way to run some custom kernel/rootfs on FVP is to use the Shrinkwrap
tool [3]. First install it following the quick start guide [4] (I would
recommend using the Docker backend if possible). Then build the firmware
stack using:

$ shrinkwrap build -o arch/v9.0.yaml ns-edk2.yaml

To make things easy, the runtime configuration can be stored in a file.
Create ~/.shrinkwrap/config/poe.yaml with the following contents:

----8<----

%YAML 1.2
---
layers:
  - arch/v9.0.yaml

run:
  rtvars:
    CMDLINE:
      type: string
      # nr_cpus=1 can be added to speed up the boot
      value: console=ttyAMA0 earlycon=pl011,0x1c090000 root=/dev/vda rw
  params:
    -C cluster0.has_permission_overlay_s1: 1
    -C cluster1.has_permission_overlay_s1: 1

----8<----

Finally start FVP using:

$ shrinkwrap run -o poe.yaml ns-edk2.yaml -r
KERNEL=<out>/arch/arm64/boot/Image -r ROOTFS=<rootfs.img>

(Use Ctrl-] to terminate the model if needed.)

<rootfs.img> is a file containing the root filesystem (in raw format,
e.g. ext4). The kernel itself is built as usual (defconfig works just
fine), just make sure to select CONFIG_KPKEYS_HARDENED_PGTABLES to
enable the feature. You can also select
CONFIG_KPKEYS_HARDENED_PGTABLES_TEST to run the tests in patch 15.

Thank you for your interest and support, very appreciated!
