Thanks and sorry for work done that may not land - the maintainers may
prefer the approach in your patch and my opinions matter little to
them. If it is any consolation I wrote an entire Rust symbol demangler
[1] that I don't expect to land :-) I also appreciate that you've been
cleaning up the tools build infrastructure along with your changes,
something there isn't enough of.

Thanks,
Ian
