Great.

The problem with gaps in parallelism is usually how things change
over time. If you have e.g. idle periods they tend to look different
in the profile. with the full aggregation you don't see it, but with
a time series it tends to stand out.

But yes that approach usually only works for large gaps. I guess
yours is better for more fine grained issues.

And I guess it might not be the most intutive for less experienced
users.

This is BTW actually a case for using a perf data GUI like hotspot or
vtune which can visualize this better and you can zoom arbitrarily.
Standard perf has only timechart for it, but it's a bit clunky to use
and only shows the reschedules.

If you're lucky and the problem is not long tail you can use a high
percentage cut off (--percent-limit) to eliminate most of the data.

Then you just have "topN functions over time" which tends to be quite
readable. One drawback of that approach is that it doesn't show
the "other", but perhaps we'll fix that one day.

But yes that perf has too many options and is not intuitive and most
people miss most of the features is an inherent problem. I don't have
a good solution for that unfortunately, other than perhaps better
documentation.

Very nice! Looks useful.

Perhaps add that variant to tips.txt too.
