Coming back from this. It would be fine if we could do the back trace when
we come back from the scheduler, so it should not be an issue if the task
even has to schedule again to fault in the sframe information.

I was also wondering if the unwinder doesn't keep track of who requested
the back trace, just that someone did. Then it would just take a single
flag in the task struct to do the back trace. Return the "cookie" to the
tracer that requested the back trace, and when you do the back trace, just
call all callbacks with that cookie. Let the tracer decided if it wants to
record the back trace or ignore it based on the cookie.

That is, the tracers would need to keep track of the cookies that it cares
about, as if there's other tracers asking for stack traces on tasks that
this tracer doesn't care about it needs to handle being called when it
doesn't care about the stack trace. That said, if you want to trace all
tasks, you can just ignore the cookies and record the traces.
