If under the format specification it's legal, there is no reason for
the kernel to proactively reject it, IMO. But ok, whatever.

yep, agreed, seems like a worthwhile thing to support, given the stats

regard)

even u16 seems dangerous, I'd use u32, not sure it's worth limiting
the format just to 64K unique combinations

I'm not sure about this chunked lookup approach for arbitrary user
space applications. Those executable sections can be a) big and b)
discontiguous. E.g., one of the production binaries I looked at. Here
are its three main executable sections:

...
  [17] .bolt.org.text    PROGBITS         000000000b00e640  0ae0d640
       0000000011ad621c  0000000000000000  AX       0     0     64
...
  [48] .text             PROGBITS         000000001e600000  1ce00000
       0000000000775dd8  0000000000000000  AX       0     0     2097152
  [49] .text.cold        PROGBITS         000000001ed75e00  1d575e00
       00000000007d3271  0000000000000000  AX       0     0     64
...

Total text size is about 300MB:
>>> 0x0000000000775dd8 + 0x00000000007d3271 + 0x0000000011ad621c
312603237

Section #17 ends at:

>>> hex(0x0000000011ad621c + 0x000000000b00e640)
'0x1cae485c'

While .text starts at 000000001e600000, so we have a gap of ~28MB:

>>> 0x000000001e600000 - 0x1cae485c
28424100

So unless we do something more clever to support multiple
discontiguous chunks, this seems like a bad fit for user space.

I think having all this just binary searchable is already a big win
anyways and should be plenty fast, no?

I do like the idea of deduplicating those records and just indexing
them, as in practice this should probably be much more compact. So it
might be worth looking into this some more. I'll defer to Indu.
