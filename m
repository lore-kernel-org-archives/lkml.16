It breaks broken userspace :)

No, which is why I am working to fix these tools so that it will not be
broken.

Great, as it is easy to get this type of fix into the stable kernels,
and then fix these tools, by the time those old systems eventually
update to a newer kernel version, it should "just work".

I'm fixing up the bug where all of these devices accidentally got dumped
into the root of the device tree in the system.

Again, /sys/devices/ is NEVER guaranteed to have specific placement,
that's the whole point of sysfs in the first place.  We can, and do,
move devices around in there all the time (even every other boot), it's
just that some tools accidentally didn't realize this and now need to be
fixed.

This "grey area" between the kernel and userspace of sysfs (and other
virtual filesystems), always gets tweaked and changed over time.  sysfs
makes it much simpler to make those changes in relation to other
filesystems like /proc/ which is why it was designed this way in the
first place.
