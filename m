This is well known to the people involved.

While the PMU driver needs to encode or avoid these event names, they
become special "legacy" names inside the perf tool. Magically a name
like cpu_cycles will wildcard match (match on >1 PMU) whilst a name
like cpu-cycles won't (only matching on core PMUs). This is completely
confusing to users. It is even more confusing when you are saying the
tool should intentionally use two different encodings.

The perf event enum types are limited but the tool recognizes more
event names and then uses legacy encodings. I have yet to hear a
sensible list of what are legacy event names, is cpu-cycles in there
or just cycles? Why on earth would you want to keep synonyms like LLC
meaning L2 cache?

The intention with "pmu syntax" for events is that the PMU clarifies
the type in the perf_event_attr. Previously it was assumed that the
PMU type would be raw (4), and the x86 PMUs even use that as their
type number. Pretending these days we don't now have hybrid core PMUs,
10s of uncore PMUs. Doing that work had to reinvent event parsing and
encoding.

If you look at the matching as it is today:
cpu_cycles -> tries to match on all PMUs
*/cpu_cycles/ -> tries to match on all PMUs
arm*/cpu_cycles/ -> tries matches on all PMUs that have arm at the start
armv8_pmuv3/cpu_cycles/ -> matches only the armv8_pmuv3 PMU

I don't see why it isn't obvious that the behavior of no PMU and the
PMU being * is expected to be exactly the same - it really is today
and that is what the code does, please try it. There just isn't a
notion of not having a PMU because even for legacy events we have to
reinvent the PMUs to inject the correct extended type information
otherwise we'd profile just a fraction of the cores. We add PMUs when
we display events to make the events more readable. There isn't a
notion of these events being legacy and not, they are just assumed to
be the same, PMU or not.

As I've explained to you, I plan to transition the metric code to use
event parsing and to union evlists rather than use strings and hash
tables. This is to fix tracepoints appearing incorrectly to always
have suffixes in the "metric-id" calculation. Recognizing modifiers
properly would end up reinventing event parsing, so let's just make
use of what we have and parse events early. It makes sense when
unioning evsels in an evlist to do it off of the perf_event_attr, this
will allow Intel's slots and topdown.slots to be correctly detected as
aliases in metrics, something of a pain in formulas today. Why would
the behavior of an event like cycles be different in non-hybrid
metrics (where PMUs generally aren't specified) and in hybrid metrics
(where PMUs generally are specified)? Events may not be recognized as
aliases because ones without a PMU in the metric will get a legacy
encoding. In your change:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20221018020227.85905-16-namhyung@kernel.org
you assume all events with the same name are in fact the same event,
but that is making wild assumptions about what is placed in the evsel
name and I am trying to fix it in:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250201074320.746259-1-irogers@google.com/
You did similar with your proposal for hwmon events and I rejected it.
The fact that the name term in an event configuration clobbers an
evsel's name, its just the intent of the thing and the name was never
supposed to have some sacred legacy or whatever meaning.

I still see no sense in:
perf stat -e cpu_cycles ...
meaning:
perf stat -e */cpu_cycles/ ...
and:
perf stat -e cpu-cycles ...
trying to mean close to:
perf stat -e cpu/cpu-cycles/ ...
why one is implicitly a * and the other a core PMU, I mean it is the
definition of confusing. And in the latter cpu-cycles case you want
those two events to be encoded differently.

All of this is overlooking that we have 1 event that is a problem on 1
PMU on 1 architecture. If it weren't for that event we'd already have
this patch landed and consistent event encodings. By not taking the
patch it hurts Apple M, RISC-V users and my own work.

Please can you explain why keeping the current encoding is good and if
we like legacy events so much, can we revert the changes to prioritize
sysfs/json when a PMU name is present. I'm afraid what you are
explaining makes no sense to me, breaks existing platforms (Apple M)
and is a blockage to future work. Saying everyone should rewrite
everything, that's not a workable solution - not least because in some
situations (old PMU drivers on Apple M) we lack a time machine.

Thanks,
Ian
