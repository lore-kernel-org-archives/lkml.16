I'd second this. Some cases are reasonably well behaved and
regions 'kind of work' for PA based tracking some very much not.
Add anything like overcommitted VMs on top and contiguity of 'hotness'
beyond very small regions goes out the window very quickly (unfortunately
I'm not able to share specific data).

So there are definitely cases where I'd expect something else to be needed.

There are a plenty of approximate tracking methods in the literature
that might be good enough with much lower overhead than precise tracking
(sketches etc) if we can feed them the right data.

Typically we don't need the answer on how hot all memory is, just some info
on 'this lot are particularly hot' and 'this lot are reasonably' cold.

Damon (as it currently stands) can sometimes give this info so to me
it's a possible producer of data for another layer that focuses on
abstracting the data to what we want only.  Hopefully we can make
that work for all the forms of tracking temperature that people are
looking at. I'm biased in favor of hardware units but no everyone will
have those toys available for a while yet :)
