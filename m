I think we're both aiming in the right direction, I just didn't make my
point clear.

The ID registers we make visible to userspace after KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT
*must* describe a feature set we will actually honor for the VM. No late
masking of features (i.e. first KVM_RUN), since it pretty much
guarantees userspace won't be able to save/restore correctly.

While we describe NV up front, we've been talking about allowing
userspace to make the E2H0 v. VHE selection through the ID registers as
well. My suggestion is that we have userspace select the flavor of NV
it wants (E2H0 v. VHE) up front and completely nuke from orbit the idea
of late feature fixups.

This would solve your example of XNX, as we'd apply NV enforcement early
and not expose the feature. Same would also hold for VHE-only features,
such as recursive NV.

Hopefully I made more sense this time around :)
