From a theoretical point of view, yes I agree.

You are right that the behaviour is broken and needs to be fixed, but
I am not convinced that $subject patch is the way forward. See more
below.

The problem with $subject patch is that drivers/buses are required to
check the runtime PM status, with pm_runtime_suspended(),
pm_runtime_status_suspended() or pm_runtime_active() in one of its
system suspend/resume callbacks , to synchronize it with the HW state
for its device (turn on/off clocks for example).

Certainly, we can not rely on drivers to conform to this behaviour and
there are plenty of cases where they really don't. For example, we
have drivers that only implements runtime PM support or simply don't
care about the runtime PM status during system resume, but just leaves
the device in the state it is already in.

Moreover, we have the users of pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume(),
which we also know *not* to work with DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND and thus
$subject patch too. I am less worried about these cases though, as I
believe we should be able to fix them, by taking into account the
suggested "->power.set_active flag", or something along those lines.

That said, it seems like we need another way forward.

Kind regards
Uffe
