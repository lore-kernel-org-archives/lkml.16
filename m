See mine and Sebastion's reply. Just adding another interrupt turn around,
and you already lost.

That's nice that you don't feel it. But I do. ;-)

None of that sounds to me like an RT project. I'm talking about robotics,
industrial machines, autonomous driving, power plants, etc. Where
everything is measured in WCET.
