Does QEMU support POE? The only mention I could find is here:
https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-arm/2024-03/msg00486.html
where the answer is, "no and it looks difficult". :P

Do you have any tests that could be added to drivers/misc/lkdtm that
explicitly exercise the protection? That is where many hardware security
features get tested. (i.e. a successful test will generally trigger a
BUG_ON or similar.)

As in, make sure the loaded pkey isn't leaked into an exception handler?

Is the "levels" nature of this related to how POE behaves? It sounds
like there can only be 1 pkey active at a time (a role), rather than
each pkey representing access to a specific set of pages (a key in a
keyring), where many pkeys could be active at the same time. Am I
understanding that correctly?

As hinted earlier with my QEMU question... what's the best way I can I
test this myself? :)

Thanks for working on this! Data-only attacks have been on the rise for
a while now, and I'm excited to see some viable mitigations appearing.
Yay!
