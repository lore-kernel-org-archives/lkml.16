I wasn't aware of those guidelines, thanks for the pointer! I got
inspiration from various existing tests, it unfortunately looks like the
conventions in [1] have not been universally adopted. I'll try to follow
them in the next version (of both RFC series).

That's a fair point, I've actually run into this sort of issues with the
page table tests (in the other RFC series). I can add positive tests
with a regular read (e.g. reading current->cred->uid directly) - no
fault is expected to occur in that case.

prepare_creds() does not allocate protected memory, see the introduction
in the cover letter and patch 6. However I could certainly add such
tests for the new helpers protect_creds() and prepare_protected_creds(),
which are meant to be used with override_creds().

kasan_suite_init() uses this approach if KASAN is disabled, but skipping
does seem to be a better idea - this way it doesn't show up as an error.

Thank you for the review and suggestions!
