Using BPF when available would be limited progress. The issues I have
with not removing the existing approach are:

1) It is broken
Scanning /proc for pids and then doing perf_event_open means that any
time a process exits the perf_event_open fails.
Steps to reproduce:
This bug reproduces easily but if your machine is lightly loaded in
one terminal run `perf test`, in another terminal run `sudo perf top
-u $(id -u)` the perf top command will exit with:
```
Error:
The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 3 (No such process)
for event (cycles:P).
/bin/dmesg | grep -i perf may provide additional information.
```

2) It is a work in progress that isn't progressing. Scanning /proc
will only tell you about started processes; it won't tell you about
processes that start during the profiling run, whether it be perf top
or perf record. Extra work would be necessary to make this most basic
of use-cases work, perhaps you could use tracepoints to capture
starting processes and then enable user profiling on those processes.
It would be horribly complicated, suffer from delays between observing
things happen and doing the perf_event_open, biases in the samples,
etc. I don't expect anyone to do it, especially when BPF filtering
already solves the problem better. There have been 13 years that
someone could have fixed it.

3) it adds significant useless complexity to the code base. Having
'user' in the target makes it look like perf_event_open can work on a
pid, system wide or user basis. The user basis doesn't exist so the
majority of the code base is just ignoring it - search for users of
uid_str on target. Those that do run into problems (1) and (2).

4) It is redundant and leads to confusion with BPF filtering. Having
the BPF filter on evsels is non-zero cost in terms of the code base
complexity, but it is something broadly useful. As user filtering has
never worked (see above) it isn't broadly used but is adding
complexity. If both approaches were wanted then it is unclear what the
code should be doing, presumably the mish-mash of BPF filtering and
/proc scanning that happens today and will be broken due to (1) and
(2). Putting everything into the BPF filter makes sense as you can
combine a BPF filter with an additional BPF filter on user.

5) It is untested and adding a test leads to an always broken test due
to testing being an example of where things break, see point 1 and its
example.

6) Nobody wants the non-BPF approach. As it was broken nobody used the
previous feature, maintaining it for no users is overhead. Let me know
if someone is using this option (I doubt it given points 1 and 2) and
they wouldn't be better served by BPF. People building perf today have
to explicitly opt-out of wanting BPF in their tooling. I posted this
change a month ago and nobody has jumped up saying please don't remove
the old approach.

7) The interaction with this feature and changes in behavior, say
ignoring events that fail to open, is non-obvious and not testable as
testing would be broken as the functionality itself is broken. Having
the broken feature hanging around and being untestable means that we
slow progress on new features, testing and other improvements.

Yes, we could try to fix all of that but why? Nobody has cared or
tried in 13 years and I would like the tech debt off our plate with a
better approach in its place.

Thanks,
Ian
