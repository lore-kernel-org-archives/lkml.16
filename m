But we want to see the module information for modules that were loaded
during the trace. If a module is removed and suddenly the system crashed,
we just lost that information. Hence why I reset the module information
when the tracing starts.

No. The buffer is only cleared if one of its events were ever enabled. If
no event within the module was enabled, then the buffer is not cleared.

If we have them enabled.
