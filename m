It because the perf adds "slot" as a tool event for the e-core Topdown
metrics.
There is no "slot" event for e-core.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/perf/util/metricgroup.c#n1481

I will check why "slot" event is added as a tool event for e-core?
That doesn't make sense.
