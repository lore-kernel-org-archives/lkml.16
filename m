I confirmed this with a trace, this is indeed the case.

I retract this statement, it was based on my knowledge from back when I implemented it.

Looking at the current code again, this should be possible and can be a nice cleanup regardless.

(Or I just might have forgotten the reason that made me think back then that this is not worth it,
because I do remember well that I wanted to make IRQWIN inhibit to be per vcpu)

Basically to do so we need to introduce per-vcpu inhibit field (instead of .vcpu_get_apicv_inhibit_reasons callback)
set the inhibit bit there in svm_enable_irq_window, and raise KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE.

Same thing in interrupt_window_interception().

Nested code can be updated to do so as well very easily. IMHO this is a very nice cleanup.

I'll prepare a patch soon for this.

Also regardless, I strongly support Paolo's idea to inhibit APICv/AVIC when more than one ExtINT entry is
enabled, although this might not be enough:

In fact multiple vCPUs with ExtINT enabled I think can trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE below:

kvm_cpu_has_extint will be true on both vCPUs, so kvm_cpu_has_injectable_intr will be true on both
vCPUs as well, and thus both vCPUs can try to pull the interrupt from PIC, with second one likely getting -1,
and that not to mention the possibility of corrupting PIC state due to the concurrent access.


I am talking about this code:


	if (kvm_cpu_has_injectable_intr(vcpu)) {
		r = can_inject ? kvm_x86_call(interrupt_allowed)(vcpu, true) :
				 -EBUSY;
		if (r < 0)
			goto out;
		if (r) {
			int irq = kvm_cpu_get_interrupt(vcpu);

			if (!WARN_ON_ONCE(irq == -1)) {
				kvm_queue_interrupt(vcpu, irq, false);
				kvm_x86_call(inject_irq)(vcpu, false);
				WARN_ON(kvm_x86_call(interrupt_allowed)(vcpu, true) < 0);
			}
		}
		if (kvm_cpu_has_injectable_intr(vcpu))
			kvm_x86_call(enable_irq_window)(vcpu);
	}


So we might need to do something stronger than only inhibiting APICv/AVIC, we might
want to ignore second ExtINT entry, or maybe even better ignore both ExtInt entries and refuse to deliver ExtINT at all? 
(the guest is broken (Intel says that this configuration is frowned upon), so IMHO it deserves to keep both pieces. Do you agree?)


Best regards,
